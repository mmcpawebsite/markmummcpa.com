Any information you provide us is handled with the utmost confidentiality.
Your personal information will only be shared with members of our firm who
need to know this information in oder to complete the work you have hired our
firm to do. We will not disclose your personal information to anyone outside
our firm without your express written permission to do so, or unless we are
legally required to do so. For example, if a mortgage lender contacts our
office for a copy of your return or information about it, we will ask that you
provide written permission prior to our responding to that request.

You should also be aware that anything you tell us during the interview for
the preparation of your tax return is confidential, but not protected from the
IRS. Priveleged communications (those that are protected from IRS authority to
compel our testimony) are limited to non-criminal tax advice on matters before
the IRS or non-criminal tax proceedings in federal courts. Although we
consider any information you provide us as confidentional, return preparation
engagements are not covered by advisor-client priviledge. If you feel the
nature of any subject matter to be discussed requires protected
communications, please raise that issue so that we can discuss your possible
need to consult with an attorney for legal advice.
